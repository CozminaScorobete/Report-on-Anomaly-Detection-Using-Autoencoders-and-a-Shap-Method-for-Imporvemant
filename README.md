# Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders and SHAP

## 📝 Description
This project implements an anomaly detection system using autoencoders and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature interpretability. The autoencoder identifies anomalies by reconstructing input data and flagging deviations, while SHAP explains which features contribute most to the anomalies.


## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Autoencoder architecture
- **SHAP** - Feature importance analysis
